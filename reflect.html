            The textbooks look to be a great help. I am glad to have this resource. </p><hr>
        b. I participated in the discussion board.<hr>
        c. Attended and reviewed class meeting, Br. Thayne was knowledgeable 
        and supportive to course details and seems sincere to help us learn. <hr>
        d. I'm looking forward to accomplishing and focusing on the course outcomes.<hr>

    <div class="content">
      <p>   
        a. Found HTML AND CSS not like riding a bike, so spent time to study and recall the conventions. Setting up my site and being topic one was a great exercise to start.  I did spend more time than I’d like to admit, but feel much more proficient. <a href="https://lamont-michelle.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">index.html</a>
        I began Topic one: Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays. I"m still a little confused on the course flow.   
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. Learned about extensions and the usability of Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. Began personal website – new to Visual Studio Code</p><hr>
        b. Assigned to team members, but one member dropped the course. My teammate and I made a schedule. Another team member would lighten the load.<hr>
        c. Communication has been on the canvas group thread. My teammate volunteered to initiate the zoom links and do our recordings. <hr>
        d. This course is helping with a self-reliant attitude in my learning. Going forward next week with teach to learn principles.<hr>
        </p>

    <!--WEEK 03-->
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 03</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>   
        a. I set up github pages for my code. <a href="https://lamont-michelle.github.io/" target="_blank">my github pages</a>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. I continued with topic one this week. Although a lot of the basic syntax is familiar, I learned some new concepts: the for-in and for-as loops for looping objects. 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript loops</a></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I enjoyed Topic 3, working with JSON. I have worked with JSON before, so this came quickly and made more sense than before. I was able to write JavaScript code to parse() and then stringify(). String to object, then object to string.
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp" target="_blank">JSON.parse()</a>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp"target="_blank">JSON.stringify()</a></p><hr>
        b. My teammate and I met on zoom. It was a successful meeting. My teammate prepared a description of Topic 2, 
        JavaScript objects. My teammate taught me a great deal and I could connect some object concepts in my mind. 
        Brother Thayne has aligned a third team member. 
        <hr>
        c. I was able to share my understanding of Topics 1 and 3 in our meeting.<hr>
        d. The course material is looking less daunting and the structure of the course less confusing. <hr>
    </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 04</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>   
        a. The topic I focused this week was Topic 5: Local APIs, local and session storage.  
        This valuable use of storage simplifies the use of passing data. Note: this is not a 
        secure way to pass data. Here's a great source: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp" target= "_blank">w3schools</a> My favorite knowledge this week was in the developers tool. <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. In the application tab, what data is held in the storage is viewable.  I had some fun with code creation to practice this principle. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I was glad I had brushed up on JSON and could find the storage and display of array and objects to be quite fun. </p><hr>
        b. Since teammate1 was to be out of town, we split the meetings to two. 
        Meeting1 was with teammate2,  where I was taught Topic 6: DOM document 
        object model.  In the meeting with teammate2, a presentation about AJAX 
        was helpful. Having each team member teach before I study the topics has 
        distinct advantages.   I’m looking forward to delving into these topics 
        with two great teammates.<hr>
        c. Communication in our team is viable. I’m having a personal pitfall 
        with internet connectivity issues.  I will replace our modem on Monday. <hr>
        d. I am finding this practice to focus on one topic/ principle at a 
        time in detail, is a better way to learn than high pressure code project 
        delivery by midnight Saturday. (As the expectation of CS courses) this 
        an improved model of 'teach to learn'. <hr>
        </p>

    <!--WEEK 05-->
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 05</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>   
        a. I did have some fun learning about DOM manipulation. 
        Here's a great source: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_navigation.asp" target= "_blank">w3schools</a> 
        I think this is my favorite thing. I did CSS alterations using Javascript.  
        I prepared a presentation on this Topic7 and prepared to present Topic2. <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. After many shameful hours, I had Br. Thayne help me with my issue with the .io, and had success! Thank you, Brother Thayne! </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I liked teaching myself more about the DOM tree and malipulating the nodes. </p><hr>
        b. Frustratingly, my internet did not sustain in my group meeting. 
        I will have to re-watch their lessons and make my own videos to share, 
        next week looks brighter.  <hr>
        c. Struggled this week (an ER visit complicated the week.)
        Plus, a new modem did not fix my connectivity issue. Our carrier has 
        sent two technicians, two different days. We replaced the modem again, 
        as of Saturday night. <hr>
        d. I decide to start some brain storming on my final app. I started 
        with an idea I am excited about.  If anything, it’s fun to have an 
        unscripted assignment. <hr>
        </p>

    <!--WEEK 06-->
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 06</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>   
        a. This week was about Topic 11 and 13: CSS3 Transitions and CSS3 animations. 
        I really enjoyed these topics when I had first thought it was going to be difficult. 
        I created a couple simple boxes and tested several methods to make them move. 
        With animation, I was able to bounce and lengthen the box.
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. I did another powerpoint presentation. I feel this works better for me to teach a topic, so I don't loose track of my thoughts.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. Learning about transitions was fun. Then the door opened to animation: letting in the possiblities of endless ideas.</p><hr>
        b. Thursday, I finally had working internet for our meeting. What a relief. 
        I was able to present my 2 topics and learn from both my teammates. It was a good meeting.
        It seems we are all keeping up and teaching/learning on schedule. <hr>
        c. I feel my powerpoints helped me communicate and teach what I learned.<hr>
        d. Stretching what I think is going to difficult has proven well. So many topics become a 
        great review, new skill, and strength for the future.<hr>
    </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 07</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>   
        a. This week I studied AJAX and topic 9: java script events.
        I studied ALAX by looking through APIs on the internet. I also 
        tried to expand javascript with more challenging code. <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. I used a google api and found how to use the developers tools to take timing and use of API calls.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I learned more about using calls to call into the different nodes deeper into the DOM with . notations.</p><hr>
        b. We met early this week to make time for Halloween family time.  I benefited the most as we discussed topics and they helped me understand a few concepts of confusion.  I appreciated them a great deal. <hr>
        c. Communication is good in our team.  My turn to teach topic 9 was a bit broken. I needed to follow up on my own study since I rushed to meet Wednesday. <hr>
        d. I’m looking forward to some feedback from submissions. I hope I am covering the topics well enough to pass them off with good marks.  I am enjoying teaching myself when I initially wondered what guidance this course would offer. <hr>
        </p>
    </div>
    <!--WEEK 08-->
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 08</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>   
        a. This week I studied DOM manipulation for topic 6, and I added topic 8, Creating CSS3 Transitions and Animations with Javascript trigger, to my study since the schedule was only Topic 6 for me.  Hopefully I will finish all topics next week.  Then I will have week 10 for fixes, if needed.<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. I enjoy DOM manipulation, understanding the nodes relations better, and some uses to make some creative code.  Although, it took me awhile to get removeChild() to work, it was a great learning experience. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I spent some time to make sure I understood the difference between transition and animation. Transition as a change of state and animations for series of movement (keyframes). </p><hr>
        b. My team is patient with me and are helpful to teach and answer my questions if they can.  I appreciate it. They teach me every week. <hr>
        c. Communication is good. I know we are all balancing our jobs, families, and course work. My team always meets and teaches each other. Online students are the most dedicated people I know!  =)<hr>
        d. The feedback I got for my first 3 topics helped me know my efforts have been in the right direction. <hr>

    <!--WEEK 09-->
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 09</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>   
        a. This week I studied HTML5 video, audio, canvas tags.  I also studied CSS transforms, which is topic12.<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. Initially the media tags were so simple, I decided to add button controls using JavaScript, which used some basic conditional statements. I had some fun with canvas, but wondered how this is used in industry. Is this mainly for gaming?</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii.  I had some success with the skew, rotate, translate and scale. These I felt demonstrated basic functionality. I’m trying to decide if I should add more to the topic before submission. </p><hr>
        b. Our team meeting was just Breanna and I. We covered topics we both have discussed before. But we also discussed our team project, which benefited me the most.<hr>
        c. Communication is good.  Our meetings are staying on schedule.<hr>
        d. I think I’m progressing. If the idea is to try, try, try :I’m nailing it. I’m glad Br. Thayne has his meetings, videos, and office times. <hr>

    <!--WEEK 10-->

    <div class="content">
            <p>   
            a. I was so excited to get to this week and have stayed on schedule. I did some final touches on topics and dug deeper into how to set up my final app.<br>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. Topic 9 probably took me the longest, mostly because I really wanted to try some new things.  I learned a lot.  Started in week 7 and finished in week 10. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. Some of my experimentation was to use flex boxes, so I could reuse them in the future. I thought this could have been a topic, itself.</p><hr>
            b. I appreciated each of my team members. It is really helpful as an online student to get an opportunity to talk with others.<hr>
            c. Last team meeting was helpful for me. We had zero complications with communication.<hr>
            d. I hope my topics will help me with the creation of my final app. I feel encouraged this will be the case. Time to create! <hr>
            </p>

    <p>   
        a. Rolling out the final app has been fun. I just know I have got to keep a steady pace. I have a fear of hitting some snags.<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. First, I wanted to get a great api, but I have decided to write my own JSON file and stop spending so much time looking.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I typed up the ideas I have for the app and drew some sketches. I came up with some functionalities to meet the parameters. I spend a great deal of time on HTML and CSS, so I need get to work on the javascript functions.</p><hr>
        b. Team meetings have concluded.<hr>
        c. Communication is open, but I am focused on the app right now. I hope I will not need to meet for help from the instructor or tutor. <hr>
        d. I feel the value in the final project. I am hoping to pull together all the topics I have learned. The topics are good resources indeed. <hr>

            a. I'm having some great learning activities and experiences this week. Where the pressure is off; next week will feel more rushed. <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. I am working on CRUD methods. I have been able to have the user create and modify a list from a drop menu.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I am using local storage so the user will be able to see the list they created when they return.</p><hr>
            b. No teamwork this week.<hr>
            c. No communication this week. I read teacher announcement and viewed some previous class videos. <hr>
            d. I'm going to feel great when all my components come together(or horrified if they don't, gulp). I have separated files and will be excited to merge for the final result.<hr>

        a. Best thing about this course has been using and learning more JavaScript. It has become my favorite language, if its possible to claim a favorite.<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">i. I am looking into Angular2 and ASP.NET to learn on my own. Although I enjoyed Android studio and java, VSC and javascript have been more fun. What is next?</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">ii. I took on more JavaScript than HTML and CSS for my project. I felt this is what would propel me forward to next semester.</p><hr>
        b. My family was helpful this week to get some user testing. The app is very simple, as prescribed in the requirements. I adjusted a few minor things. I might still enjoy adusting a few more cosmetics things at the last minute. My other classes need some attention first. =)<hr>
        c. I have had a few questions and had them answered. No complaints or problems.<hr>
        d. I built some confindence toward the end of the course, which has given me some ideas for a senior project. I am looking forward to starting. <hr>
