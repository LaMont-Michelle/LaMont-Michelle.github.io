        a. Set up github repository for the course <a href="https://github.com/LaMont-Michelle" target="_blank">my Github</a><br>
        <pre>
i. Downloaded visual studio 
code, linked the platform to 
Github. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VSC download</a>
ii. Downloaded textbooks and 
reviewed: 
<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html" target="_black">Eloquent Javascript</a>

The textbooks look to be a 
great help. I am glad to have 
this resource. 
        </pre><hr>
        b. I participated in the discussion board.<hr>
        c. Attended and reviewed class meeting, Br. Thayne was knowledgeable 
        and supportive to course details and seems sincere to help us learn. <hr>
        d. I'm looking forward to accomplishing and focusing on the course outcomes.<hr>

        a. Found HTML AND CSS not like riding a bike, so spent time to study and recall the conventions. Setting up my site and being topic one was a great exercise to start.  I did spend more time than I’d like to admit, but feel much more proficient. <a href="https://lamont-michelle.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">index.html</a>
        I began Topic one: Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays. I"m still a little confused on the course flow.   
        <br>
        <pre>
i. Learned about extensions 
and the usability of Visual 
Studio Code.
ii. Began personal website 
– new to Visual Studio Code</pre><hr>
        b. Assigned to team members, but one member dropped the course. John and I made a team schedule. Another team member would lighten the load.<hr>
        c. Communication has been on the canvas group thread. John volunteered to initiate zoom link and recordings. <hr>
        d. This course is helping with a self-reliant attitude in my learning. Going forward next week with teach to learn principles.<hr>

        a. I set up github pages for my code. <a href="https://lamont-michelle.github.io/" target="_blank">my github pages</a>
        <br>
        <pre>
i. I continued with topic one 
this week. Although a lot of 
the basic syntax is familiar, 
I learned some new concepts: 
the for-in and for-as loops 
for looping objects. 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript loops</a>
ii. I enjoyed Topic 3, working 
with JSON. I have worked with 
JSON before, so this came  
quickly and made more sense 
than before. I was able to 
write JavaScript code to 
parse() and then stringify(). 
String to object, then object 
to string.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp" target="_blank">JSON.parse()</a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp"target="_blank">JSON.stringify()</a>
</pre><hr>
        b. John and I met on zoom. It was a successful meeting. John prepared a description of Topic 2, 
        JavaScript objects. He taught me a great deal and I could connect some object concepts in my mind. 
        Brother Thayne has aligned a third team member. 
        <hr>
        c. I was able to share my understanding of Topics 1 and 3 in our meeting.<hr>
        d. The course material is looking less daunting and the structure of the course less confusing. <hr>
