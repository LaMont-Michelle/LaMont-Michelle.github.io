        a. Set up github repository for the course <a href="https://github.com/LaMont-Michelle" target="_blank">my Github</a><br>
        <pre>
i. Downloaded visual studio 
code, linked the platform to 
Github. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VSC download</a>
ii. Downloaded textbooks and 
reviewed:

The textbooks look to be a 
great help. I am glad to have 
this resource. 
        </pre><hr>
        b. I participated in the discussion board.<hr>
        c. Attended and reviewed class meeting, Br. Thayne was knowledgeable 
        and supportive to course details and seems sincere to help us learn. <hr>
        d. I'm looking forward to accomplishing and focusing on the course outcomes.<hr>

      <p>   
        a. Found HTML AND CSS not like riding a bike, so spent time to study and recall the conventions. Setting up my site and being topic one was a great exercise to start.  I did spend more time than I’d like to admit, but feel much more proficient. <a href="https://lamont-michelle.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">index.html</a>
        I began Topic one: Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays. I"m still a little confused on the course flow.   
        <br>
        <pre>
i. Learned about extensions 
and the usability of Visual 
Studio Code.
ii. Began personal website 
– new to Visual Studio Code</pre><hr>
        b. Assigned to team members, but one member dropped the course. My teammate and I made a schedule. Another team member would lighten the load.<hr>
        c. Communication has been on the canvas group thread. My teammate volunteered to initiate the zoom links and do our recordings. <hr>
        d. This course is helping with a self-reliant attitude in my learning. Going forward next week with teach to learn principles.<hr>
        </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">WEEK 03</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>   
        a. I set up github pages for my code. <a href="https://lamont-michelle.github.io/" target="_blank">my github pages</a>
        <br>
        <pre>
i. I continued with topic one 
this week. Although a lot of 
the basic syntax is familiar, 
I learned some new concepts: 
the for-in and for-as loops 
for looping objects. 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript loops</a>
ii. I enjoyed Topic 3, working 
with JSON. I have worked with 
JSON before, so this came  
quickly and made more sense 
than before. I was able to 
write JavaScript code to 
parse() and then stringify(). 
String to object, then object 
to string.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp" target="_blank">JSON.parse()</a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp"target="_blank">JSON.stringify()</a>
</pre><hr>
        b. My teammate and I met on zoom. It was a successful meeting. My teammate prepared a description of Topic 2, 
        JavaScript objects. My teammate taught me a great deal and I could connect some object concepts in my mind. 
        Brother Thayne has aligned a third team member. 
        <hr>
        c. I was able to share my understanding of Topics 1 and 3 in our meeting.<hr>
        d. The course material is looking less daunting and the structure of the course less confusing. <hr>

        <p>   
        a. The topic I focused this week was Topic 5: Local APIs, local and session storage.  
        This valuable use of storage simplifies the use of passing data. Note: this is not a 
        secure way to pass data. Here's a great source: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp" target= "_blank">w3schools</a> My favorite knowledge this week was in the developers tool. <br>
        <pre>
i.  In the application tab, 
what data is held in the 
storage is viewable.  I had 
some fun with code creation 
to practice this principle. 
ii. I was glad I had brushed 
up on JSON and could find the 
storage and display of array 
and objects to be quite fun. 
</pre><hr>
        b. Since teammate1 was to be out of town, we split the meetings to two. 
        Meeting1 was with teammate2,  where I was taught Topic 6: DOM document 
        object model.  In the meeting with teammate2, a presentation about AJAX 
        was helpful. Having each team member teach before I study the topics has 
        distinct advantages.   I’m looking forward to delving into these topics 
        with two great teammates.<hr>
        c. Communication in our team is viable. I’m having a personal pitfall 
        with internet connectivity issues.  I will replace our modem on Monday. <hr>
        d. I am finding this practice to focus on one topic/ principle at a 
        time in detail, is a better way to learn than high pressure code project 
        delivery by midnight Saturday. (As the expectation of CS courses) this 
        an improved model of 'teach to learn'. <hr>

      <p>   
        a. I did have some fun learning about DOM manipulation. 
        Here's a great source: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_navigation.asp" target= "_blank">w3schools</a> 
        I think this is my favorite thing. I did CSS alterations using Javascript.  
        I prepared a presentation on this Topic7 and prepared to present Topic2. <br>
        <pre>
i. After many shameful hours,
 I had Br. Thayne help me 
 with my issue with the .io, 
 and had success! 
 Thank you, Brother Thayne!
ii. I liked teaching myself 
more about the DOM tree and 
malipulating the nodes. 
            </pre><hr>
        b. Frustratingly, my internet did not sustain in my group meeting. 
        I will have to re-watch their lessons and make my own videos to share, 
        next week looks brighter.  <hr>
        c. Struggled this week (an ER visit complicated the week.)
        Plus, a new modem did not fix my connectivity issue. Our carrier has 
        sent two technicians, two different days. We replaced the modem again, 
        as of Saturday night. <hr>
        d. I decide to start some brain storming on my final app. I started 
        with an idea I am excited about.  If anything, it’s fun to have an 
        unscripted assignment. <hr>

    <p>   
        a. This week was about Topic 11 and 13: CSS3 Transitions and CSS3 animations. 
        I really enjoyed these topics when I had first thought it was going to be difficult. 
        I created a couple simple boxes and tested several methods to make them move. 
        With animation, I was to bounce and lengthen the box.
        <br>
        <pre>
i. I did another powerpoint 
presentation. I feel this works 
better for me to teach a topic, 
so I don't loose track of my 
thoughts.
ii. Learning about transitions 
was fun. Then the door opened 
to animation: letting in the 
possiblities of endless ideas.
            </pre><hr>
        b. Thursday, I finally had working internet for our meeting. What a relief. 
        I was able to present my 2 topics and learn from both my teammates. It was a good meeting.
        It seems we are all keeping up and teaching/learning on schedule. <hr>
        c. I feel my powerpoints helped me communicate and teach what I learned.<hr>
        d. Stretching what I think is going to difficult has proven well. So many topics become a 
        great review, new skill, and strength for the future.<hr>
